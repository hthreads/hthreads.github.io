## Graduate Classes Offered by the CSDL Lab

### [EECS 5013 Domain Specific Accelerators](/classes/domain-specific-accelerators)
The rise of computationally expensive machine learning applications occured with the ending of Dennard scaling and slowing of Moore's Law.   Domain Specific Accelerators (DSAs) and Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) are our industries current path forward to meet the continually expanding computational demands of machine learning applications.  DSAs offer increased efficiencies of transistor densities on the matrix-vector type and spatial concurrency of the computations that dominate machine learning algorithms compared to general purpose processors. 

### EECS 5013 Post Moore’s Law Computer Architectures

The end of Dennard scaling and slowdown of Moore’s law has ushered in a new era called Post Moore’s Law Computing. This course will look at the trends, applications, and emerging architectures that are defining this new era.

### EECS 5843 Reconfigurable Computing

A graduate-level course on the state of the art in Reconfigurable Computing

### Multiprocessor Systems-On-Chip

A graduate-level course that covers modern MPSoC design issues and methodologies.

### EECS 5013 Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)

A senior level/graduate-level course that covers real-time systems and the issues related to operating system design for those systems.

### EECS 5013 Adaptive Systems

A senior level/graduate-level course that gives student the basics of autonomic systems and have them design a workable adaptive system, conceptually and technically, based on the partial reconfiguration capabilities of FPGAs.
