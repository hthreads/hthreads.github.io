# Course Description

The design and analysis of modern HW/SW co-designed embedded systems. Modern design flows and approaches for creating and controlling System on Chip integrated components. Real time and reactive modeling and implementation of control loops and data processing. System level integration techniques for multiprocessor components and accelerators.

This class will make use of the Xilinx/Digilent Arty7 Development Board. This development board contains a modern Virtex series FPGA along with various peripherals such as Ethernet, USB, Audio In/Out, LEDs, buttons, switches, VGA, etc. Various System-On-Chip (SoC) architectures will be developed during this class, all of which will be implemented within the fabric of the FPGA. Most, if not all, of the SoCs developed during this class will use the MicroBlaze processor; a soft 32-bit processor core developed by Xilinx. The instruction set architecture, or ISA, of the MicroBlaze will be studied and used throughout this class, in order to teach students the relationships between high-level languages, assembly language, and the actual hardware implementation of computer systems.
