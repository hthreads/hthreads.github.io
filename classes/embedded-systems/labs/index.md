## Prelabs

Some labs will have a prelab component, these must be completed before lab. Students who have not completed their prelab will be denied entry into lab.

It is not necessary to print your prelabs. Showing an electronic copy on your device will be sufficient.

## Lab Reports

You are required to complete a lab report after each lab. The report along with any code files from that lab will be due on Friday of the following week.
