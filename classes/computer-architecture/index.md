## Introduction

Welcome to CSCE 4213 Computer Architecture. It is truly an exciting time to study computer architecture as we are about to engage in a major change in how computers are built ! In this class you will first become familiar with how to measure performance and understand current trends in how the industry is building computers. Then, you will study many of the important historical techniques that the computer industry has developed over the last 20 years for building fast and scalable scalar microprocessors for desktop and general purpose computers. Jumping off from the study of scalar microprocessors, you will study many of the techniques originally developed during the 1980's for building parallel machines that are now being pursued for the next generation of machines. This next generation, referred to as manycores, represents a significant switch from building machines with powerful and fast single microprocessors, towards building machines with multiple CPU's. As this switch occurs it is important to study how memory hierarchies, interconnect networks, compilers and operating systems, and even programming languages must also be changed to enable the industry to switch from scalar to parallel machines.
