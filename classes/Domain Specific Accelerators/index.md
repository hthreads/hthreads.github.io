## Introduction

Moore’s Law expanded the use of general-purpose computer components into every niche of our lives. Expansion into new markets reduced component costs and supported a continuous cycle of new architecture enhancements. These enhancements combined with transparent clock frequency increases to provide a periodic cycle of exponential performance increases that characterized the era of Moore’s Law. The ending of Dennard scaling ended the era of exponential performance increases and Moore’s Law continues to slow. The recent rise of computationally demanding machine learning and big data analytics applications combined with the slowdown of performance increases to usher in a new era of domain specific architectures as well as domain specific languages. This course will study both the economic as well as technical changes that are driving a change from general purpose to custom and application specific accelerators. The course will introduce students to domain specific accelerator architectures including but not limited to systolic arrays, array processors, in/near memory, and neuromorphic computing models, NVM analog accelerators, and application driven custom designed accelerators. Materials for this course will be drawn from the literature. Students will be required to make presentations and engage in a semester project.
