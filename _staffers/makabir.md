I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. while carrying out my role as a research assistant at the Computer Systems Design Lab at the CSCE department of the University of Arkansas. 
My doctoral research involves the investigation of a reconfigurable memory-centric array processor architecture for Deep-Learning Acceleration on FPGA.
This architecture will open up the advantages of FPGA and in-memory processing to the broader Deep-Learning user community, offering abstraction and application-specific customization features.
