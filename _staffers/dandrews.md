Warning: Scam Alert !!!
Someone is posing as me and offering online jobs to people. Apparently, their email looks very authentic but this is NOT ME. This "job offer" has nothing to do with me or the University of Arkansas. Do not respond to their emails, and do not attempt to deposit any fake checks they send you. They are simply trying to trick you out of your money.
