# Computer Systems Design Laboratory

## Laboratory Overview

---

Welcome to the Computer Systems Design Laboratory at the University of Arkansas. Research in CSDL encompasses system specification and verification, modeling abstractions, HW/SW co-design, CAD/CAE, operating systems, special purpose architectures, compilers, security, special computer architectures, and real-time embedded systems. Current research being done in the Computer Systems Design Laboratory (CSDL) can be viewed on our Projects page. Knowledge is also folded back into both the undergraduate and graduate curriculum in some of our Classes, Lab Notes, and through Reading Groups.

The faculty of the CSDL hold primary teaching responsibility for departmental undergraduate classes in digital design, computer organization, computer architecture, embedded systems, and systems modeling. Graduate classes taught by CSDL faculty span reconfigurable computing, multiprocessor systems on chip (MPSoC), and asynchronous logic design. The CSDL hosts visiting researchers and scholars from other research groups world wide, and supports a colloquium series of invited experts. Undergraduate, Masters, and PhD students form the core of CSDL in an interdisciplinary and team based environment.

We encourage you to explore the research and teaching components of our laboratory.
